# FOOD-DELIVERY-TIME-PREDICTOR---Convolutional Neural Network (Apriori)
**Food Delivery Time Predictor using Convolutional Neural Network (Apriori)**

This model was built on Kaggle Notebook since the code might not work on Jupyter Notebook due to version diferences or the use of Jupyter Web (which isnt the problem with Kaggle Notebook). The main source code utilises Machine Learning Algorithms specified to give the required output (included with the code itself).

**Original Kaggle Notebook Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/code/aayushmancodez/food-delivery-time-prediction-cnn-v6

**To run the model:**

1) Open Kaggle.

2) Create a new Notebook.

3) Copy and paste the source code from this project into your new notebook.

4) Run the notebook to see the output.

**Model Summary**

Type of Model: Convolutional Neural Network (Apriori Algorithm)

Objective: The goal is to understand relationship between food delivery time and various factors affecting it like customer location, restaurant location, weather, traffic conditions, etc. This dats will be used for further comparision using the Apriori Algorithm. This dataset will be used to explore CNN and evaluation/validation techniques.

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
